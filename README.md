# Code-comparator
Given two(or more) codes with supposedly same functionality, tries to find testcases for which their outputs are different.

# How to Use?
Put many code files by the names starting with "code"{"code1.py", "code2.cpp", "code3.c", "code4.java"} in project directory. Put an input-format file by the name "thein.txt" if you want testcase_generator to generate the testcases or else put "mycases.txt" if you have your own testcases. Run main.py and enjoy!
